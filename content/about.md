I am an ~~undergraduate student~~ aspiring developer in Vancouver, Canada. I like helping people, solving problems, and doing cool things. 

My best projects so far are a [chess engine](/projects/chess_engine), a [video display made of addressable Christmas Lights](/projects/christmas-lights-v2), and an [analytics dashboard](/projects/ers-dashboard). 

I also have done some [fractal stuff](/projects/fractals) if you want something cool to look at.

Currently, I'm looking into Rust, and Transformers.

Like most personal blogs, this site is constantly out of date with all the fun stuff I'm currently doing. Mostly because I'm too busy doing the fun stuff to update it.
